The front left wheel has been removed, and it's pretty obvious that all of the ball joints need to be replaced
since there is lots of cracking, and subsequently grease everywhere. I used the Dremel tool to cut off the lower
ball joint's pin since it wouldn't come out with pliers. I then used the appropriate crescent wrench to get the
castle nut off the top. To knock the arm loose, I had to use a large hammer. The upper left ball joint was harder,
and as a result, I used the truck's tire iron to free it. Now that it's off I can't knock the arm free. That's the next step.
